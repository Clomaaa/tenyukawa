        <br>
        &emsp; &emsp; Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves. Heat-related illnesses grow as temperatures rise, making it difficult to work and move. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.
        <br> <br>
        <b class="bb"> 2. A warming, rising ocean. </b>
        <br>
        &emsp; &emsp; The ocean absorbs most of the heat from global warming. Rising sea levels  threatens coastal and island communities as ice sheets melt. The ocean also absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere. More CO2 makes the ocean acidic, endangering marine life.
        <br> <br>
        <b class="bb"> 3. Loss of species. </b>
        <br>
        &emsp; &emsp; Climate change threatens the survival of terrestrial and marine organisms. The dangers rise with the temperature. A few threats are forest fires, harsh weather, pests, and illnesses. Some species can  migrate and survive, but not all.

             <p class="p1">Decreased Snow Cover</p>
                &emsp; &emsp; Snow has a global impact. Due to its brightness, it absorbs only a small percentage of sunlight and reflects the rest back into space. Snow covers regulate heat exchange between the surface and the atmosphere, balancing the Earth's energy budget.
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; Multiple snow cover extent products have been developed over time, allowing us to publish maps regularly, if not daily. It started in 1972 when scientists used satellite photos to track snow. And so they discovered a 50 year decline in snow cover. Studies show that between 1979 and 2012, the Arctic's snow cover decreased by 17.6% per decade compared to the 1979 to 2000 average. An annual loss of 1,870 square kilometers of snow cover in North America. From 2011 to 2020, the average annual snow cover was 3.25 million square miles, nearly 2% less than the first decade when humans began measuring. This is a 77,700 square mile difference.
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; Spring snow is also vanishing earlier than usual, with the biggest drops occurring in June. Snow should cover the Northern Hemisphere for nine months each year, but between 1972 and 2013, the US snow cover season shrank by two weeks. Along with a general decrease in snow cover, researchers discovered a significant increase in loss since 2003. From 2008 to 2012, Eurasia had the lowest snow cover extent. A link between air temperature and snow cover was found using this method.

             <p class="p3">Rise of Sea Levels</p>
                &emsp; &emsp; Water is a basic human need that can be used both directly and indirectly. It is used directly for bathing, drinking, and cooking, as well as indirectly for making steel and paper. Fortunately for us, water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, with 97% of it being oceans and seas.
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp;  
                In 1993, satellites were used to track changes in sea level. According to global tidal data, sea level rose by 4 to 5 inches between 1900 and 1990. After 25 years, sources revealed that the sea level had risen three inches, and is now rising at an eighth of an inch per year. This number is expected to rise by one to eight feet by 2100. Furthermore, high-tide flooding is now 300-900% more common along the US coastline than it was 50 years ago.
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp;  Rising sea levels are caused by two main factors. The first is when a warm ocean expands due to the high global temperature, taking up more space in the ocean basin. Another is linked to glacier melting, which will replenish the ocean once it melts. As a result, the rapid rise in sea level can be linked to human-caused warming.

             <p class="p5">Extreme Weather</p>
                &emsp; &emsp; Weather is the short-term state of the atmosphere at a specific location and time. It has an impact on the amount of rainfall and temperature in a certain location, which has a wide range of consequences for the people. Crop growth rates, food availability, and individual activities are all factors to consider.
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp;  
                Extreme weather and climatic events have unfortunately become more common in recent decades. Global precipitation has increased at an average rate of 0.1 inch each decade since 1901, while altering weather patterns have resulted in a few locations receiving less precipitation than usual. Heavy downpours have become more common, and the frequency of days with heavy rainfall has increased as well. Heat waves have been on the rise, with the number now nearly tripling the long-term norm. Furthermore, since the 1950s, the frequency and severity of winter storms has grown, and their trajectories have begun to shift over the United States. Extreme occurrences have become much more common in the last 15 years, according to academics, and they are projected to become even more common in the future.

                &emsp; &emsp; Since the late 1800s, the average surface temperature of the Earth has risen by about 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit (1.18 degrees Celsius), due primarily to increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities. Worldwide, 2016 was the warmest year on record, 2020 was the second-warmest, and 2011–2020 was the warmest decade on record since thermometer-based observations began. 
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp;  
                Global average surface temperature has risen at an average rate of 0.17°F per decade since 1901. It has been found that the average global temperature is likely to rise by more than 1.5°C within the next 20 years and this warming will result in more frequent and widespread extreme weather events - including heatwaves, heavy rainfall, drought, wildfires and ocean acidification all of which have already been increasing in severity around the planet.

                &emsp; &emsp; Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30%. Ocean acidification is largely the result of loading Earth’s atmosphere with large quantities of CO2, produced by vehicles and industrial and agricultural processes. The ocean has absorbed between 20% and 30% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in recent decades (7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year). 
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp;  
                Some scientists estimate that the pace of ocean acidification since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution has been approximately 100 times more rapid than at any other time during the most recent 650,000 years. They note that concentrations of atmospheric CO2 between 1000 and 1900 CE ranged between 275 and 290 parts per million by volume (ppmv). In 2010 the average concentration was 390 ppmv, and climatologists expect the concentration to rise to between 413 and 750 ppmv by 2100, depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions.

            <br>
           In the range of 90˚ and 105˚F (32˚ and 40˚C), you can experience heat cramps and exhaustion. Between 105˚ and 130˚F (40˚ and 54˚C), heat exhaustion is more likely. You should limit your activities at this range. An environmental temperature over 130˚F (54˚C) often leads to heatstroke.

            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; EM radiation is created when an atomic particle, such as an electron, is accelerated by an electric field, causing it to move. The movement produces oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which travel at right angles to each other in a bundle of light energy called a photon. <br> <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; EM radiation spans an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies. This range is known as the electromagnetic spectrum. The EM spectrum is generally divided into seven regions, in order of decreasing wavelength and increasing energy and frequency. The common designations are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared (IR), visible light, ultraviolet (UV), X-rays and gamma rays. Typically, lower-energy radiation, such as radio waves, is expressed as frequency; microwaves, infrared, visible and UV light are usually expressed as wavelength; and higher-energy radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, is expressed in terms of energy per photon. </div>

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The atmosphere of the Earth is transparent to radio waves with wavelengths of a few millimetres to about twenty metres. As radio waves enter Earth's atmosphere from space some of the waves are absorbed by the electrons in the ionosphere while others pass through and are detectable to ground based observers. Low frequency radio waves do not travel very far through the atmosphere and are absorbed or reflected rather quickly.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The Earth's atmosphere is transparent to some wavelengths of microwave radiation, but not to others. The longer wavelengths (waves more similar to radio waves) pass through the Earth's atmosphere more easily than the shorter wavelength microwaves.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Infrared radiation strikes a molecule such as carbon dioxide and causes the bonds to bend and vibrate, this is called the absorption of IR energy. The molecule gains kinetic energy by this absorption of IR radiation. This extra kinetic energy may then be transmitted to other molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen and causes a general heating of the atmosphere. The main atmospheric constituents that prevent infrared radiation from reaching the Earth's surface is water vapour, and, to a lesser extent, Carbon Dioxide.

Visible light is not blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, although clouds and dust can scatter some of the light back.

All these effects, however, are found to have a minor impact on climate in comparison to recent man-made global warming.

            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The ozone layer is a region of high ozone concentration in the stratosphere, 15 to 35 kilometres above Earth's surface. The ozone layer acts as an invisible shield and protects us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. 
            <br> <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation from the sun. When an ozone molecule absorbs UV-B, it comes apart into an oxygen molecule (O2) and a separate oxygen atom (O). Later, the two components can reform the ozone molecule (O3).

        <div class="nucp4">
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  It is a known fact that the sun gives off light which allows us to see but visible light isn’t the only thing that our sun emits. Additionally, the sun exudes UV and infrared radiation. Knowing this, What do you think will happen when all this radiation hits our atmosphere? Some may speculate that the gasses in the air absorb it, heating up in the process while others might suggest that it passes straight through the atmosphere and is absorbed by the Earth surface. On the other hand, a considerable number of people might also point out that it is reflected back into space by clouds. Actually, all three happen! A small percentage of radiation is absorbed by oxygen (O₂) and ozone (O₃) in the atmosphere, but most passes through and heads straight for the Earth’s surface. About 33% of this radiation is then reflected, but 67% is absorbed by the Earth’s surface, heating the planet up.
            <br> <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; When we say the Earth "absorbs radiation," we mean that it absorbs solar energy and then releases it as infrared radiation. Because infrared radiation has a longer wavelength than visible light, it is absorbed by the atmosphere to a greater extent (unlike the shortwave radiation from the sun). In particular, infrared radiation is absorbed by gases known as greenhouse gases, which then re-radiate the infrared waves in all directions, some into space and some back to Earth. This causes further warming at the Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere. This additional warmth is referred to as the “greenhouse effect”.

                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Particle radiation is made up of any subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons, and high-speed electrons, capable of causing ionization. Alpha and beta particles are two of the more common types of particle radiation. They come from the nuclei of radioactive atoms through radioactive decay. Particle radiation has a mass component, may have a charge, and travels at varying speeds (slower than the speed of light). Meanwhile, Electromagnetic radiation is an electric and magnetic disturbance traveling through space at the speed of light (2.998 × 108 m/s). It contains neither mass nor charge but travels in packets of radiant energy called photons, or quanta.
